### Hey folks 👋

My name is Igor Rates and I'm a software engineer from Brazil currently working at Rock Content 🚀. 
Also a Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer 🤓

Always excited to work on new challenges. I’ve been working for over 12 years with software/web development and there’s not a single day I get bored because it is what I love to do.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an architectural upgrade in one of the biggest SaaS products in my current company. We are changing from the DotNet Framework to DotNet5. It will enable better scalability, reliability and also will help to reduce costs
- 🏫 Learning NodeJS, ReactJS, and React-Native with the guys at RocketSeat. So far loving the bootcamp.
